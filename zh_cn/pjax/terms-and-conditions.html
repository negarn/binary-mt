                        <li>Subject to network latency, we endeavour to execute your Order within a reasonable time from the time you triggered the Order, at the Price nearest to your specified Price.

If you close your original Transaction and fail to cancel the Stop or Limit Order, we shall be entitled, at our absolute discretion, to treat the Stop or Limit Order as an instruction to enter into a new Transaction for you if and when our quote reaches or goes beyond the level of the Stop or Limit Order.</li>

                        <li>Throughout the duration of the Transaction and for as long as the Transaction is open, you are required to maintain a sufficient Account Equity to cover any Margin Requirement. If your Account Equity is less than the Margin Requirement in relation to the open Transaction you wish to create, you have entered into a Margin Call and you are required to fund the shortfall immediately. You may not be able to place an Order to open a Transaction until the shortfall has been funded and there is sufficient Account Equity to cover the Total Margin.</li>
                        <li>You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to monitor your Account Balance and Margin Requirement and we are not under any obligation to keep you informed (i.e., to make a Margin Call).</li>

                </li>
                <li>保证金要求和计算
                    <ul class="bullet">
                        <li>The Margin Requirement is a percentage of the value of the Open Positions and will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the value of the Open Positions throughout the duration of the relevant contracts (the "Contract Value").</li>
                        <li>The Margin Requirements can increase / decrease based on the aggregated size of your Open Position determined by the volume (number of lots), contract size (value per point in the original currency of the contract), market price and margin rate.</li>
                        <li>We may modify Margin Requirements for any Open Positions or new Transactions entered into, at our sole discretion. Formulas for Margin Requirements published on the website are indicative only and may be changed by the Company at its discretion at any time, due to changing market conditions or other factors.</li>
                        <li>Whilst we endeavour to close out your Open Positions if and when the Margin Level for your Real Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, we do not guarantee that your Open Positions will be closed when the Margin Level for your Real Account reaches the Stop Out Level.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Stop Out Level

                        <li>如果您真实账户的保证金水平达到或低于强制平仓水平，将被归类为默认事件。在这种情况下，未平仓头寸将按照以下顺序自动平仓: (i) 服务器分析当前没在执行的客户订单;（ii） 服务器删除保证金最高的订单;（iii） 如果您的保证金水平仍然低于强制平仓水平，下一个订单将被删除 （没有保证金要求的订单不会被删除）;（iv）如果您的保证金水平仍然低于强制平仓水平，服务器将亏损最大的头寸平仓;（v） 未平仓头寸将强制平仓，直到您的保证金水平高于强制平仓水平。</li>
                        <li>The default Stop Out Level applicable to your Account is published on our website. However, the default Stop Out Level is subject to alteration at our absolute discretion. Any changes to the Stop Out Level will take effect immediately.

                        <li>The margin trading services described in this Agreement are conducted over the counter. This means that the market in one or more of the instruments which you ordinarily transact with us, though quoted on an exchange, are not traded on an exchange when transacted through the electronic trading platform as described in this Agreement.</li>
                        <li>You acknowledge that the Company will determine, at its discretion, the Transactions that will be kept in the Company's own book (known as B booking) and the Transactions that will be passed through to the prime brokers who act as liquidity providers for the Company (known as A booking). For the latter, the Company is the counterparty in these transactions and a correlation between the profit/loss made by the client and the profit/loss made by the Company exists. At any point in time, we may be entering into or may have entered into transactions with a large number of clients, each of whose interests may diverge from those of other clients. As such, the Company may be holding Open Positions that may not be aligned with your objectives/interests as an individual client of the Company.</li>
                        <li>Whilst we endeavour to take all reasonable and sufficient steps, as required by applicable laws and regulations, to identify potential conflicts of interests between ourselves and our clients, or between one client and another, that arise in the course of providing the margin trading services as described in this Agreement, by establishing and implementing policies and procedures, it is possible that we may execute certain Transactions which may have other direct or indirect material interests.</li>

    <h2>Risk Disclosure Statement</h2>
    <p>This Risk Disclosure Statement is not exhaustive and is not intended to constitute a comprehensive statement of all the risks to which you might be exposed to and does not describe all risks inherent to forex and contracts for differences that exist now or which may arise in the future. Its objective is rather to provide you with information for you to reasonably understand the risks associated with forex and contracts for differences offered by Binary.com in our interest to provide you with the best possible trading experience.</p>

    <h2>外汇和差价交易合约涉及高风险，是一种投机活动</h2>
    <p>外汇和差价交易合约涉及高风险，是一种投机活动，因为您可推测基础金融工具价格的短期变动。除非您能接受比您存入资金更大的亏损，不然您不适合参与外汇交易和 （或） 签订差价交易合约。重要的是您需了解，如果要从持仓头寸获取任何回报，您必须参与相应的交易将持仓头寸平仓，有时候在一些市场条件下您可能很难或无法做到此点。</p>

    <h2>执行模型和交易对手风险</h2>
    <p>Binary.com通过混合模式提供外汇和差价合约，即通过自己的账户（交易员）和部分对冲客户订单与我们的流动率提供商（无交易员）进行交易。当总交易量超过预定的风险承受力水平限额时，客户订单通常被对冲。Binary.com在两种执行模式中都扮演您与我们签订交易的合约相对方，而不是像交易所的交易金融工具那样与中央结算所订立交易的合约相对方。 因此，存在相对方风险。 相对方风险是指客户因为您签订的外汇和/或差价交易合约相对方在交易现金流最终结算前违反其义务而造成的损失风险。</p>

    <h2>杠杆</h2>
    <p>融资融券交易中，杠杆指使用保证金增加/扩大交易数值。杠杆的表达方式是比率。举个例子，如果杠杆是50: 1，您将能够持有比保证金高出 50 倍的交易头寸。当您投资一种杠杆产品时，您的盈利或亏损将根据杠杆的头寸计算，也就是说，您为账户设置的杠杆比率决定了您的交易增加/扩大数值。</p>
    <p>杠杆可以用于生成比从您的账户余额拨出进行开盘持仓交易（您的保证金）的金额高出多倍的回报。然而，进行可能带来更大投资回报的投资具更高风险。这意味着，如果价格走势对您不利，您将蒙受比从您的账户余额拨出进行开盘持仓交易（您的保证金）的金额高出多倍的亏损。</p>
    <p>如果您不打算使用杠杆功能，请将杠杆比率设为 1:1。</p>

    <h2>Relationship between Margin and Leverage</h2>
    <p>The leverage ratio refers to the number of times your margin (the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction) can be "leveraged" to enter into a Transaction. The denominator of the leverage ratio is always 1. A 50:1 leverage is equivalent to a 2% margin requirement (1 divided by 50 = 2%). The leverage ratio that we/you establish will determine the amount of margin required. As leverage is inversely proportional to margin, the lower the leverage you set for your Account, the higher the margin required to be set aside from your account balance (your margin requirement).</p>

    <h2>Risk of Stop Order</h2>
    <p>The system fills orders on a first-in-first out basis, i.e. based on the sequence of the order received, and this is beyond our control. As a result, you may find it difficult or impossible to close a position at the intended price stipulated in your Stop Order during certain market conditions. The placement of Stop Order by you, though useful as a risk management tool, will not necessarily limit your losses to your intended amounts, in the event of highly volatile trading conditions, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders and there is uncertainty about your possible exit price. In short, a Stop Order is not guaranteed because it cannot operate whatever the market circumstances are.</p>

    <h2>Regular monitoring of open positions</h2>
    <p>Trading forex and contracts for differences carries a high level of risk and Binary.com does not monitor the open positions of your account on your behalf. It is your responsibility to monitor your Open Positions and understand the exposure of your Open Positions whilst ensuring that your exposure commensurate with your risk appetite. Due to the cost associated with overnight open positions, you should consider investing in the market of the instrument in which you ordinarily transact in instead of investing in a CFD.</p>

    <h2>Risk of slippage</h2>
    <p>Whilst we endeavour to open or close the Transaction to which your orders relate at the requested price, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution, there are times when, due to an increase in volatility or volume, orders may be subject to slippage. The difference between the order price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage. This means that your order is not filled at the exact intended quoted price when you placed your order. Slippage is usually seen during periods of extremely high or low volatility and generally occurs during fundamental news releases or periods of limited liquidity. Slippages can result in either a positive slippage (more favourable to you) or a negative slippage (less favourable to you).</p>

    <h2>外部力量</h2>
    <p>Your forex and contracts for differences transactions with Binary.com are linked to an underlying financial instrument and you will be exposed to price, currency exchange, interest rate or other volatility of the market to which your financial instrument is related to, especially if the market is of a jurisdiction that is foreign to you. Forex and contracts for differences trading over the internet via an electronic trading platform is subject to data latency risk which may result in delays in order execution.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Where a particular venue has been specified in your instructions with respect to the execution of an order, we will not be responsible for the venue selection.</p>
        <p>Where a particular time or timeframe has been specified in a client's instructions with respect to the execution of an order, regardless of the price available, we will endeavour to execute the order at the specified time or over the specified timeframe in the best possible manner after taking all sufficient steps. However, we will not be responsible for any consequences related to pricing that resulted from the time or timeframe of the execution.</p>
        <p>不受具体指示影响的客户订单相关事宜必须符合Binary.com订单执行政策的使用需求。客户没有提供具体指示时，为了向您提供最佳执行措施，我们将根据以下执行标准自行确定所需要考虑的因素：</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>the characteristics of the client;</li>
            <li>the characteristics of the order;</li>
            <li>the characteristics of financial instruments that are the subject of that order;</li>
            <li class="no-bullet">and</li>
            <li>the characteristics of the execution venues to which that order can be directed.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>五、最佳执行义务</h2>
        <p>当我们代替您执行订单时，也就是说，当您依法托付我们执行您的订单并维护您的利益时，Binary.com 有义务以最佳方式执行。</p>
        <p>代您执行订单时，为了替您争取最佳成果，Binary.com 将考虑以下各点︰</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>价格 - 您的订单相关的交易执行价格。</li>
            <li>费用 - 您的订单执行费用主要由价差，即我们的标价和我们提供的价格之间的区别组成。</li>
            <li>Speed - the speed at which your order can be executed.</li>
            <li>执行和结算可能性 - 您的订单相关的市场流动性深度。</li>
            <li>Size - the size of your order determined by the volume (number of lots).</li>
            <li>任何其他与交易执行相关的事项。</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The factor listed above are not listed in order of priority. Ordinarily, price will merit a high relative importance in obtaining the best possible result for you. However, the relative importance of the listed factors above may change in accordance with:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>the specific instructions that we receive from you;</li>
            <li>the market conditions of the financial instruments that your orders are related to, which includes the need for timely execution, availability of price improvement, liquidity of the market, size of your order, and the potential impact on total consideration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>在某些情况下，我们所决心的执行因素相对重要性可能与您的不相同。我们根据最佳执行义务操作，为您争取最大利益。</p>

    <h2>六、执行场地</h2>
        <p>Binary.com通过混合模式提供外汇和差价合约，即通过自己的账户（交易员）和部分对冲客户订单与我们的流动率提供商（无交易员）进行交易。</p>
        <p>When we deal on own account (dealing desk), we act as principal and not as an agent on your behalf and we therefore act as the execution venue.</p>
        <p>Whilst we act as principal in respect of your orders, we also assess the execution venues that we use and upon which we place significant reliance to provide the best possible result for the execution of your orders. These venues typically consist of third party investment firms, brokers, and/or liquidity providers.</p>
        <p>为使我们的最佳执行义务能让您实现更佳成果，Binary.com 定期评估外部执行场地选项（每年至少一次） 。</p>

    <h2>七、订单处理</h2>
        <p>所有客户订单将以先进先出，没有任何人工干预的方式处理。执行您的订单时，Binary.com 将尽快以指示价格 （或可用的更佳价格）填补您的订单交易记录。基于内部治理安排和风险管理框架建立的接触限值将与我们活动的大小、性质、复杂性和风险架构相配合。这些接触限值是区分自动接受订单和可用于将填补水平传递给客户端市场的订单的基准。</p>

    <h2>八、监测和审查</h2>
        <p>We will monitor the effectiveness of our order execution arrangements and order execution policy. We will assess from time to time whether the venues relied upon by us in pricing our Contracts on your behalf allow us to achieve best execution on a consistent basis or whether we need to make changes to our execution arrangements. We will also review our order execution arrangements and order execution policy in respect of material changes either in respect of one of our chosen pricing venues or that otherwise affect our ability to continue to achieve best execution. Should there be any material changes to our order execution arrangements or order execution policy, we will notify you.</p>

    <h2>附录 - 产品具体政策</h2>

    <h2>一、现货外汇</h2>
        <p>关于Binary.com 提供的Spot FX 特点和交易说明，请参阅产品披露声明。这项政策是Binary.com 综合性订单执行政策的附录，须与 Binary.com 综合性订单执行政策一起阅读。</p>
        <p>Binary.com在管理传入订单时通过采用智能聚合方法为您提供最佳执行方案。智能聚合方法的工作原理是︰</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>consolidating liquidity from several providers into a single stream of blended feed; and</li>
            <li>intelligently routing incoming orders to different types of execution modes based on configurations and algorithms established using best execution factors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>默认情况下，智能订单路由系统确保记录本的最顶部位总是由最佳竞标价格和参与竞争的流动性提供商报价组成。然而，在市场流动性不足的时候，这种情况可能会改变，并由执行可能性作主要执行因素。</p>
        <p>基于我们作为您的交易相对方所接触的风险水平，我们在您的交易中参与大部分的主要活动。因此，执行场所通常是在Binary.com。然而，我们可能会将您的订单转给第三方流动性提供商。在这种情况下，我们将根据以上所述自行确定执行场所。</p>
        <p>The execution venues are assessed, on a regular basis, whether the they provide for the best possible result for our clients.</p>
