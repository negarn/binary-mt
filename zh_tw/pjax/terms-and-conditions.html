                        <li>Subject to network latency, we endeavour to execute your Order within a reasonable time from the time you triggered the Order, at the Price nearest to your specified Price.

                <li>保證金要求和計算
                    <ul class="bullet">
                        <li>The Margin Requirement is a percentage of the value of the Open Positions and will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the value of the Open Positions throughout the duration of the relevant contracts (the "Contract Value").</li>

                        <li>We may modify Margin Requirements for any Open Positions or new Transactions entered into, at our sole discretion.

                        <li>Whilst we endeavour to close out your Open Positions if and when the Margin Level for your Real Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, we do not guarantee that your Open Positions will be closed when the Margin Level for your Real Account reaches the Stop Out Level.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>強制平倉層次

This means that the market in one or more of the instruments which you ordinarily transact with us, though quoted on an exchange, are not traded on an exchange when transacted through the electronic trading platform as described in this Agreement.</li>
                        <li>You acknowledge that the Company will determine, at its discretion, the Transactions that will be kept in the Company's own book (known as B booking) and the Transactions that will be passed through to the prime brokers who act as liquidity providers for the Company (known as A booking). For the latter, the Company is the counterparty in these transactions and a correlation between the profit/loss made by the client and the profit/loss made by the Company exists. At any point in time, we may be entering into or may have entered into transactions with a large number of clients, each of whose interests may diverge from those of other clients. As such, the Company may be holding Open Positions that may not be aligned with your objectives/interests as an individual client of the Company.</li>

    <h2>風險披露聲明</h2>
    <p>此風險披露聲明並非詳盡無遺，也並非包含您可能會接觸到的所有風險的全面聲明。此聲明也並不能描述外匯交易和合約現存的固有風險或將來可能發生的所有風險差異。其目的在於為您提供及讓您合理理解Binary.com在符合我們利益的同時為您提供的最佳外匯與差價合約交易經驗相關的風險資訊。</p>

    <h2>外匯和差價交易合約涉及高風險，是一種投機活動</h2>
    <p>外匯和差價交易合約涉及高風險，是一種投機活動，因為您可推測基礎金融工具價格的短期變動。除非您能接受比您存入資金更大的虧損，不然您不適合參與外匯交易和 （或） 簽訂差價交易合約。重要的是您需了解，如果要從持倉頭寸獲取任何回報，您必須參與相應的交易將持倉頭寸平倉，有時候在一些市場條件下您可能很難或無法做到此點。</p>

    <h2>執行模型和交易對手風險</h2>
    <p>Binary.com通過混合模式提供外匯和差價合約，即通過自己的帳戶（交易員）和部分對沖客戶訂單與我們的流動率提供商（無交易員）進行交易。當總交易量超過預定的風險承受力層次限額時，客戶訂單通常被對沖。Binary.com在兩種執行模式中都扮演您與我們簽訂交易的合約相對方，而不是像交易所的交易金融工具那樣與中央結算所訂立交易的合約相對方。因此，存在相對方風險。相對方風險是指客戶因為您簽訂的外匯和/或差價交易合約相對方在交易現金流最終結算前違反其義務而造成的損失風險。</p>

    <h2>槓桿</h2>
    <p>融資融券交易中，槓桿指使用保證金增加/擴大交易數值。槓桿的表達方式是比率。舉個例子，如果槓桿是50: 1，您將能夠持有比保證金高出 50 倍的交易頭寸。當您投資一種槓桿產品時，您的盈利或虧損將根據槓桿的頭寸計算，也就是說，您為帳戶設定的槓桿比率決定了您的交易增加/擴大數值。</p>
    <p>槓桿可以用於生成比從您的帳戶餘額撥出進行開盤持倉交易（您的保證金）的金額高出多倍的回報。然而，進行可能帶來更大投資回報的投資具更高風險。這意味著，如果價格走勢對您不利，您將蒙受比從您的帳戶餘額撥出進行開盤持倉交易（您的保證金）的金額高出多倍的虧損。</p>
    <p>如果您不打算使用槓桿功能，請將槓桿比率設為 1:1。</p>

    <h2>保證金與槓桿之間的關係</h2>
    <p>The leverage ratio refers to the number of times your margin (the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction) can be "leveraged" to enter into a Transaction. The denominator of the leverage ratio is always 1. A 50:1 leverage is equivalent to a 2% margin requirement (1 divided by 50 = 2%). The leverage ratio that we/you establish will determine the amount of margin required. As leverage is inversely proportional to margin, the lower the leverage you set for your Account, the higher the margin required to be set aside from your account balance (your margin requirement).</p>

    <h2>止損單的風險</h2>
    <p>The system fills orders on a first-in-first out basis, i.e. based on the sequence of the order received, and this is beyond our control. As a result, you may find it difficult or impossible to close a position at the intended price stipulated in your Stop Order during certain market conditions. The placement of Stop Order by you, though useful as a risk management tool, will not necessarily limit your losses to your intended amounts, in the event of highly volatile trading conditions, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders and there is uncertainty about your possible exit price. In short, a Stop Order is not guaranteed because it cannot operate whatever the market circumstances are.</p>

    <h2>定期監測未平倉頭寸</h2>
    <p>Trading forex and contracts for differences carries a high level of risk and Binary.com does not monitor the open positions of your account on your behalf. It is your responsibility to monitor your Open Positions and understand the exposure of your Open Positions whilst ensuring that your exposure commensurate with your risk appetite. Due to the cost associated with overnight open positions, you should consider investing in the market of the instrument in which you ordinarily transact in instead of investing in a CFD.</p>

    <h2>滑點風險</h2>
    <p>Whilst we endeavour to open or close the Transaction to which your orders relate at the requested price, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution, there are times when, due to an increase in volatility or volume, orders may be subject to slippage. The difference between the order price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage. This means that your order is not filled at the exact intended quoted price when you placed your order. Slippage is usually seen during periods of extremely high or low volatility and generally occurs during fundamental news releases or periods of limited liquidity. Slippages can result in either a positive slippage (more favourable to you) or a negative slippage (less favourable to you).</p>

    <h2>外部力量</h2>
    <p>Your forex and contracts for differences transactions with Binary.com are linked to an underlying financial instrument and you will be exposed to price, currency exchange, interest rate or other volatility of the market to which your financial instrument is related to, especially if the market is of a jurisdiction that is foreign to you. Forex and contracts for differences trading over the internet via an electronic trading platform is subject to data latency risk which may result in delays in order execution.</p>

        <p>Where a particular time or timeframe has been specified in a client's instructions with respect to the execution of an order, regardless of the price available, we will endeavour to execute the order at the specified time or over the specified timeframe in the best possible manner after taking all sufficient steps. However, we will not be responsible for any consequences related to pricing that resulted from the time or timeframe of the execution.</p>
        <p>不受具體指示影響的客戶訂單相關事宜必須符合Binary.com訂單執行政策的使用需求。客戶沒有提供具體指示時，為了向您提供最佳執行方案，我們將根據以下執行標準自行確定所需要考慮的因素：</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>the characteristics of the client;</li>
            <li>the characteristics of the order;</li>
            <li>the characteristics of financial instruments that are the subject of that order;</li>

        </ul>
    <h2>五、最佳執行義務</h2>
        <p>當我們代替您執行訂單時，也就是說，當您依法託付我們執行您的訂單並維護您的利益時，Binary.com 有義務以最佳方式執行。</p>
        <p>代您执行订单时，为了替您争取最佳成果，Binary.com 将考虑以下各点︰</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>價格 - 您的訂單相關的交易執行價格。</li>
            <li>費用 - 您的訂單執行費用主要由價差，即我們的標價和我們提供的價格之間的區別組成。</li>
            <li>速度 - 您的訂單可執行速度。</li>
            <li>執行和結算可能性 - 您的訂單相關的市場流動性深度。</li>

        </ul>
        <p>The factor listed above are not listed in order of priority. Ordinarily, price will merit a high relative importance in obtaining the best possible result for you. However, the relative importance of the listed factors above may change in accordance with:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>the specific instructions that we receive from you;</li>
            <li>the market conditions of the financial instruments that your orders are related to, which includes the need for timely execution, availability of price improvement, liquidity of the market, size of your order, and the potential impact on total consideration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>在某些情況下，我們所決心的執行因素相對重要性可能與您的不相同。我們根據最佳執行義務操作，為您爭取最大利益。</p>

    <h2>六、執行場地</h2>
        <p>Binary.com 通過混合模式提供外匯和差價合約，即通過自己的帳戶（交易員）和部分對沖客戶訂單與我們的流動率提供商（無交易員）進行交易。</p>
        <p>When we deal on own account (dealing desk), we act as principal and not as an agent on your behalf and we therefore act as the execution venue.</p>
        <p>Whilst we act as principal in respect of your orders, we also assess the execution venues that we use and upon which we place significant reliance to provide the best possible result for the execution of your orders. These venues typically consist of third party investment firms, brokers, and/or liquidity providers.</p>
        <p>為使我們的最佳執行義務能讓您實現更佳成果，Binary.com 定期評估外部執行場地選項（每年至少一次） 。</p>

    <h2>七、訂單處理</h2>
        <p>所有客戶訂單將以先進先出，沒有任何人工干預的方式處理。執行您的訂單時，Binary.com 將盡快以指示價格 （或更佳的可用價格）填補您的訂單交易記錄。基於內部治理安排和風險管理框架建立的接觸限值將與我們活動的大小、性質、複雜性和風險架構相配合。這些接觸限值是區分自動接受訂單和可用於將填補層次傳遞給客戶端市場的訂單的基準。</p>

    <h2>八、監測和審查</h2>
        <p>We will monitor the effectiveness of our order execution arrangements and order execution policy. We will assess from time to time whether the venues relied upon by us in pricing our Contracts on your behalf allow us to achieve best execution on a consistent basis or whether we need to make changes to our execution arrangements. We will also review our order execution arrangements and order execution policy in respect of material changes either in respect of one of our chosen pricing venues or that otherwise affect our ability to continue to achieve best execution. Should there be any material changes to our order execution arrangements or order execution policy, we will notify you.</p>

    <h2>附錄-產品特定政策</h2>

        <p>Binary.com在管理傳入訂單時通過採用智慧型匯總方法為您提供最佳執行方案。智慧型匯總方法的工作原理是︰</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>consolidating liquidity from several providers into a single stream of blended feed; and</li>
            <li>intelligently routing incoming orders to different types of execution modes based on configurations and algorithms established using best execution factors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>預設情況下，智慧型訂單路由系統確保記錄本的最頂部位總是由最佳競標價格和參與競爭的流動性提供商報價組成。然而，在市場流動性不足的時候，這種情況可能會改變，並由執行可能性作主要執行因素。</p>
        <p>基於我們作為您的交易相對方所接觸的風險層次，我們在您的交易中參與大部分的主要活動。因此，執行場所通常是在Binary.com。然而，我們可能會將您的訂單轉給第三方流動性提供商。在這種情況下，我們將根據以上所述自行確定執行場所。</p>
        <p>The execution venues are assessed, on a regular basis, whether the they provide for the best possible result for our clients.</p>
