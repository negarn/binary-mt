                        <li>Your Real Account password and login ID are unique and passwords are hashed so that not even Binary.com staff can read them. This is the reason why we cannot retrieve your password and have to issue you with a new one to your email address if you cannot recall it;</li>

            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>F. Orders</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Order Execution/Cancellation/Modification
            <ol>
                <li>You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to understand the features, characteristics, terms and conditions of an Order and the implications of executing an Order before you place an Order with us.</li>
                <li>Subject to network latency, we endeavour to execute your Order within a reasonable time from the time you triggered the Order, at the Price nearest to your specified Price. We do not guarantee that a Transaction will be opened/closed following an Order being triggered by you at your specified Price.</li>
                <li>We endeavour to open or close the Transaction to which your Order relates at the price reasonably available to us, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution. Best execution means that we must take all sufficient steps to obtain, when executing orders, the best possible result for you, taking into account the price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature, or any other consideration relevant to the execution of the order.</li>
                <li>Our Prices are determined by reference to the price of the underlying instrument which is quoted on external exchanges or dealing facilities that we select at our discretion. Our IT infrastructure and price aggregator system facilitates the reception of quotes from shortlisted prime brokers who act as liquidity providers for us and the delivery of the quotes, derived with reference against relevant benchmark and markets, to you. You acknowledge that our Prices may differ from the bid and offer prices made available by external exchanges or dealing facilities and we are not liable for any losses that you incur arising from such differences. This clause does not apply to Volatility Indices.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Stop and Limit Orders
            <ol>
                <li>We may, at our absolute discretion, accept a Stop Order or a Limit Order from you. We may enable other types of Orders (for example, a trailing stop order) for your execution at any point in time.</li>
                <li>You may specify your instruction of a Stop Order or a Limit Order may be applied for a limited duration or for an indefinite period (a "good till cancelled" or "GTC" Order).</li>
                <li>In the case of a Stop Order, you acknowledge that we will endeavour to open/close a Transaction at the Next Available Price.</li>
                <li>In the case of a Limit Order, you acknowledge that we will endeavour to open/close a Transaction at a level that is the same or better than the Limit you specified, subject to the availability of the Limit Price. You acknowledge that at the time of order execution, our bid/offer price may become less favourable to you.</li>
                <li>You may not cancel or amend the level of your Stop and Limit Order prior to the closing of your Transaction once the level has been reached.</li>
                <li>You acknowledge that a Stop or Limit Order placed on your Open Position, when executed, would be capable of closing or partly closing your Transaction. You also acknowledge that it is your responsibility to cancel the Stop or Limit Order that you placed on your Open Positions if you do not want the Stop or Limit Order to remain valid. If you close your original Transaction and fail to cancel the Stop or Limit Order, we shall be entitled, at our absolute discretion, to treat the Stop or Limit Order as an instruction to enter into a new Transaction for you if and when our quote reaches or goes beyond the level of the Stop or Limit Order.</li>
                <li>You acknowledge that we reserve the right to establish a minimum and maximum transaction size which may be subject to alteration and that we will only execute Orders that fall within the range of the minimum and maximum transaction size.</li>
                <li>We may, at our absolute discretion, disregard your Order if an Event takes place resulting in it no longer being reasonable for us to act on your Order after indicating an acceptance of your Order.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>G. Margin</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>General Provisions
            <ol>
                <li>Prior to placing an Order which results in opening a Transaction or increasing an existing Open Position, you acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure that your Account's Free Margin is sufficient to cover the Margin required in relation to the open Transaction (the "Margin Requirement"), and to continuously meet the Margin Requirement.</li>
                <li>Throughout the duration of the Transaction and for as long as the Transaction is open, you are required to maintain a sufficient Account Equity to cover any Margin Requirement. If your Account Equity is less than the Margin Requirement in relation to the open Transaction you wish to create, you have entered into a Margin Call and you are required to fund the shortfall immediately. You may not be able to place an Order to open a Transaction until the shortfall has been funded and there is sufficient Account Equity to cover the Total Margin.</li>
                <li>You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to monitor your Account Balance and Margin Requirement and we are not under any obligation to keep you informed (i.e., to make a Margin Call).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Margin Requirement and Calculation
            <ol>
                <li>The Margin Requirement is a percentage of the value of the Open Positions and will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the value of the Open Positions throughout the duration of the relevant contracts (the "Contract Value").</li>
                <li>Margin Requirements can increase/decrease based on the aggregated size of your Open Position determined by the volume (number of lots), contract size (value per point in the original currency of the contract), market price, and margin rate.</li>
                <li>We may modify Margin Requirements for any Open Positions or new Transactions entered into, at our sole discretion. Formulas for Margin Requirements published on the website are indicative only and may be changed by the Company at its discretion at any time, due to changing market conditions or other factors.</li>
                <li>Whilst we endeavour to close out your Open Positions if and when the Margin Level for your Real Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, we do not guarantee that your Open Positions will be closed when the Margin Level for your Real Account reaches the Stop Out Level.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Stop Out Level
            <ol>
                <li>If the Margin Level for your Real Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, this will be classified as an Event of Default. In such circumstances, Open Positions are automatically closed in the following order: (i) the server analyses clients' Orders that are not under execution at the moment; (ii) the server deletes Orders with the largest Margin; (iii) if your Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the next order is deleted (orders without margin requirements are not deleted); (iv) if your Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the server closes a position with the largest loss; (v) Open Positions are closed until your Margin Level becomes higher than the Stop Out Level.</li>
                <li>The default Stop Out Level applicable to your Account is published on our website. However, the default Stop Out Level is subject to alteration at our absolute discretion. Any changes to the Stop Out Level will take effect immediately. We will endeavour to notify you of an alteration to the default Stop Out Level by publishing the revised default Stop Out Level on our website. It is your responsibility to check our website regularly and remain informed about the default Stop Out Level.</li>
                <li>The Stop Out Level applicable to your Real Account may differ from the default Stop Out Level published on our website.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Margin Payment
            <ol>
                <li>You may make Margin Payments by transferring funds from your Binary Options Real Account to your Real Account. In the event that there are insufficient funds in your Binary Options Real Account to fund your Real Account, you may make Margin Payments by funding your Binary Options Real Account and transferring the funds from your Binary Options Real Account to your Real Account.</li>
                <li>Margin Payments are due immediately and shall be received in full by us.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>H. Regulatory Provisions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Potential Conflicts of Interest
            <ol>
                <li>The margin trading services described in this Agreement are conducted over the counter. This means that the market in one or more of the instruments which you ordinarily transact with us, though quoted on an exchange, are not traded on an exchange when transacted through the electronic trading platform as described in this Agreement.</li>
                <li>You acknowledge that the Company will determine, at its discretion, the Transactions that will be kept in the Company's own book (known as B booking) and the Transactions that will be passed through to the prime brokers who act as liquidity providers for the Company (known as A booking). For the latter, the Company is the counterparty in these transactions and a correlation between the profit/loss made by the client and the profit/loss made by the Company exists. At any point in time, we may be entering into or may have entered into transactions with a large number of clients, each of whose interests may diverge from those of other clients. As such, the Company may be holding Open Positions that may not be aligned with your objectives/interests as an individual client of the Company.</li>
                <li>Whilst we endeavour to take all reasonable and sufficient steps, as required by applicable laws and regulations, to identify potential conflicts of interests between ourselves and our clients, or between one client and another, that arise in the course of providing the margin trading services as described in this Agreement, by establishing and implementing policies and procedures, it is possible that we may execute certain Transactions which may have other direct or indirect material interests.</li>
                <li>Given our role as a margin trading service provider as described in this Agreement, we seek to avoid undue market influence to the extent consistent with your trading needs and our risk management policies and procedures. By continuing to use the margin trading services described in this Agreement, you acknowledge that you are aware of the potential conflict of interest disclosed that may arise and cannot be completely eliminated, and you consent us to act notwithstanding such potential conflict of interests.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Client Money
            <ol>
                <li>Money collected from Clients are not invested in any securities, futures, or other investments, on behalf of Clients.</li>
                <li>The company holds customer funds in separate bank accounts to the operational accounts; and arrangements have been made to ensure assets in the customer accounts are distributed to customers in the event of insolvency.</li>
                <li>Your account should not be used as a banking facility and deposits should only be made with a view to using funds to place contracts. The Company is not a financial institution. Clients will not receive interest on deposits. Should you make repeated deposits and withdrawals without commensurate contracts being placed, we reserve the right to pass on to your accounts, without prior notice, any bank charges we have incurred before closing the account.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Personal Data and Privacy
            <ol>
                <li>You acknowledge that we may use, store, or otherwise process personal information provided by you in connection with the provision of margin trading services described in this Agreement.

                <li>A Transaction is opened by either executing a "Buy" or "Sell" Order based on a specified number of lots (volume) that constitute the underlying instrument of the relevant market.</li>
                <li>Any Transaction opened by you must be within any credit or position limit in effect with respect to the Real Account or any Transactions.</li>

                        <li>An Open Position may be closed by placing an opposite Order, that is an Order to sell (to close a Long Position) or to buy (to close a Short Position) in the same market for the same specified number of lots (volume).</li>
                        <li>An Open Position may be partially closed by entering into an opposite Transaction in the same Market but for a smaller number of lots (volume) as the Open Position.</li>
                        <li>If a closing Transaction in the same market is entered into but with a higher number of lots, the original Open Position will be closed and a new Open Position will be entered into for the number of lots by which the new Transaction exceeds the Open Position.</li>
                        <li>If you have entered into more than one Open Position in the same market, any closing Transaction that you place in the same market will close the Open Positions in the chronological order in which the Open Positions were first created on a first in first out basis.</li>
                        <li>Upon closing a Transaction, the realised profit (or loss), which is represented by the difference between the opening level and closing level of the Transaction multiplied by the number of lots (volume), becomes due and payable by us to you (or due and payable by you to us in cases of realised loss).</li>

This clause does not apply to Volatility Indices.</li>

You acknowledge that, upon allowing your Open Positions to remain open, you may incur further losses.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>M. Manifest Error</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>We reserve the right to void or amend the contractual terms of any Transactions that we reasonably believe are entered into at prices that do not reflect fair market prices or that are entered into at an abnormally low level of risk due to an obvious or palpable error (a “Manifest Error”). In deciding whether an error is a Manifest Error, we may take into account any relevant information, including the state of the underlying market at the time of the error and any error within, or lack of clarity of, any information source or pronouncement. You have a duty to report to us any such problems, errors, or suspected system inadequacies that you may experience and may not abuse or arbitrage such system problems or errors for profit. We will endeavour to resolve any such difficulties in the shortest time possible.</li>
        <li>Any amendments to the contractual terms of Manifestly Erroneous contracts shall be reasonable and fair.

                <li>Change the Stop Out Level in relation to your account.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The Company shall not be in breach of its obligation under this Agreement and shall not be held liable for any failure of or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement if such failure or delay is the result of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event.</li>
        <li>Nothing in this Force Majeure Event section shall be taken as indicating that it constitutes an event of default.</li>
        <li>This section on Force Majeure Events does not apply to Volatility Indices.</li>

    <h2>Risk Disclosure Statement</h2>
    <p>This Risk Disclosure Statement is not exhaustive and is not intended to constitute a comprehensive statement of all the risks to which you might be exposed to and does not describe all risks inherent to forex and contracts for differences that exist now or which may arise in the future. Its objective is rather to provide you with information for you to reasonably understand the risks associated with forex and contracts for differences offered by Binary.com in our interest to provide you with the best possible trading experience.</p>

    <h2>Forex and contracts for differences are high risk and speculative</h2>
    <p>Forex and contract for differences transactions involve a high degree of risk and are speculative because they allow you to speculate on the short term movements of the price of the underlying financial instruments. You should not enter into forex and/or contracts for differences transactions unless you are able to sustain losses that exceed your deposited funds. It is important for you to understand that in order to realise any value from your open positions, you would have to enter into a corresponding transaction to close your open positions and you may find it difficult or impossible to do so under certain market conditions.</p>

    <h2>Execution model and counterparty risk</h2>
    <p>Binary.com offers forex and contracts for differences via the hybrid model, i.e., both dealing on own account (dealing desk) and partially hedging client orders with our liquidity providers (no-dealing desk). Client orders are typically hedged when the total transaction volume exceeds a predefined threshold of risk tolerance level. For both execution models, Binary.com acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that you enter into with us, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of loss for clients resulting from the fact that the counterparty to the forex and/or contracts for differences transaction that you entered into may default on its obligations prior to the final settlement of the transaction's cash flow.</p>

    <h2>Leverage</h2>
    <p>Leverage, in the context of margin trading, refers to the use of margin to increase/amplify the value of a trade. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that you would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than your margin. When you invest in a leveraged product, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e., the increased/amplified value of your trade determined based on the leverage ratio you set for your account.</p>
    <p>Leverage can be used to generate returns that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin). However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin).</p>
    <p>If you do not intend to utilise the leverage feature, please set the leverage ratio to 1:1.</p>

    <h2>Relationship between Margin and Leverage</h2>
    <p>The leverage ratio refers to the number of times your margin (the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction) can be "leveraged" to enter into a Transaction. The denominator of the leverage ratio is always 1. A 50:1 leverage is equivalent to a 2% margin requirement (1 divided by 50 = 2%). The leverage ratio that we/you establish will determine the amount of margin required. As leverage is inversely proportional to margin, the lower the leverage you set for your Account, the higher the margin required to be set aside from your account balance (your margin requirement).</p>

    <h2>Risk of Stop Order</h2>
    <p>The system fills orders on a first-in-first out basis, i.e. based on the sequence of the order received, and this is beyond our control. As a result, you may find it difficult or impossible to close a position at the intended price stipulated in your Stop Order during certain market conditions. The placement of Stop Order by you, though useful as a risk management tool, will not necessarily limit your losses to your intended amounts, in the event of highly volatile trading conditions, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders and there is uncertainty about your possible exit price. In short, a Stop Order is not guaranteed because it cannot operate whatever the market circumstances are.</p>

    <h2>Regular monitoring of open positions</h2>
    <p>Trading forex and contracts for differences carries a high level of risk and Binary.com does not monitor the open positions of your account on your behalf. It is your responsibility to monitor your Open Positions and understand the exposure of your Open Positions whilst ensuring that your exposure commensurate with your risk appetite. Due to the cost associated with overnight open positions, you should consider investing in the market of the instrument in which you ordinarily transact in instead of investing in a CFD.</p>

    <h2>Risk of slippage</h2>
    <p>Whilst we endeavour to open or close the Transaction to which your orders relate at the requested price, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution, there are times when, due to an increase in volatility or volume, orders may be subject to slippage. The difference between the order price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage. This means that your order is not filled at the exact intended quoted price when you placed your order. Slippage is usually seen during periods of extremely high or low volatility and generally occurs during fundamental news releases or periods of limited liquidity. Slippages can result in either a positive slippage (more favourable to you) or a negative slippage (less favourable to you).</p>

    <h2>External forces</h2>
    <p>Your forex and contracts for differences transactions with Binary.com are linked to an underlying financial instrument and you will be exposed to price, currency exchange, interest rate or other volatility of the market to which your financial instrument is related to, especially if the market is of a jurisdiction that is foreign to you. Forex and contracts for differences trading over the internet via an electronic trading platform is subject to data latency risk which may result in delays in order execution.</p>

    <h2>C. Definition of Best Execution</h2>
        <p>Best execution is the requirement to take all sufficient steps to obtain, when executing orders, the best possible result for you taking into account price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature or any other consideration relevant (hereinafter referred to as the "execution factors") to the execution of the order.</p>

    <h2>D. Client Instructions</h2>
        <p>When we accept an order from you to open or close a transaction, or any other specific instructions in relation to your order, we will endeavour to follow your instructions as far as reasonably possible, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution in accordance with your instructions. These specific instructions include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a) The venue at which your order will be executed;</li>

            <li>c) The time at which your order will be executed; and</li>
            <li>d) The timeframe or duration of the contract as defined by your order execution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where a particular venue has been specified in your instructions with respect to the execution of an order, we will not be responsible for the venue selection.</p>
        <p>Where a particular time or timeframe has been specified in a client's instructions with respect to the execution of an order, regardless of the price available, we will endeavour to execute the order at the specified time or over the specified timeframe in the best possible manner after taking all sufficient steps. However, we will not be responsible for any consequences related to pricing that resulted from the time or timeframe of the execution.</p>
        <p>Aspects of a client order not affected by specific instructions are subject to the application of Binary.com's Order Execution Policy. In the absence of specific instructions from our clients, we will exercise our own discretion in determining the factors that are required to be taken into account for the purpose of providing you with best execution, having regard to the execution criteria listed below:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>the characteristics of the client;</li>
            <li>the characteristics of the order;</li>
            <li>the characteristics of financial instruments that are the subject of that order;</li>
            <li class="no-bullet">and</li>
            <li>the characteristics of the execution venues to which that order can be directed.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>E. Best Execution Obligation</h2>
        <p>Binary.com owes you a duty of best execution when executing orders on your behalf, i.e., when you are placing a legitimate reliance on us to safeguard your interest in relation to the execution of your order.</p>
        <p>In executing orders on your behalf, Binary.com takes into consideration the following to achieve the best possible result for you:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>Price - the price at which the transaction in relation to your order is executed at.</li>
            <li>Costs - the costs of executing your order comprised predominantly of spread, i.e., the difference between our bid and our offer price.</li>
            <li>Speed - the speed at which your order can be executed.</li>
            <li>Likelihood of execution and settlement - the depth of liquidity of the market in which your order is related to.</li>
            <li>Size - the size of your order determined by the volume (number of lots).</li>
            <li>Any other consideration relevant to the execution of the transaction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The factor listed above are not listed in order of priority. Ordinarily, price will merit a high relative importance in obtaining the best possible result for you. However, the relative importance of the listed factors above may change in accordance with:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>the specific instructions that we receive from you;</li>
            <li>the market conditions of the financial instruments that your orders are related to, which includes the need for timely execution, availability of price improvement, liquidity of the market, size of your order, and the potential impact on total consideration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our determination of the relative importance of the execution factors may differ from yours during certain circumstances, acting in your interest in accordance with our obligation of best execution.</p>

    <h2>F. Execution Venues</h2>
        <p>Binary.com offers forex and contracts for differences via the hybrid model, i.e., both dealing on own account (dealing desk) and partially hedging client orders with our liquidity providers (no-dealing desk).</p>
        <p>When we deal on own account (dealing desk), we act as principal and not as an agent on your behalf and we therefore act as the execution venue.</p>
        <p>Whilst we act as principal in respect of your orders, we also assess the execution venues that we use and upon which we place significant reliance to provide the best possible result for the execution of your orders. These venues typically consist of third party investment firms, brokers, and/or liquidity providers.</p>
        <p>Binary.com assesses the choice of external execution venues regularly (at least once a year) with the intention of achieving a better result for you based on our best execution obligation.</p>

    <h2>G. Order Handling</h2>
        <p>All client orders are processed on a first in first out basis without any manual intervention. When executing your order, Binary.com will seek to fill your order transaction as promptly as possible, at the instructed price (or at a better price, if available). Exposure limits are established based on internal governance arrangements and risk management framework which commensurate with the size, nature, complexity, and risk profile of our activities. These exposure limits are used as benchmarks to distinguish orders that are auto-accepted and orders that will be worked in the market with fill level passed on to the client.</p>

    <h2>H. Monitoring and Review</h2>
        <p>We will monitor the effectiveness of our order execution arrangements and order execution policy. We will assess from time to time whether the venues relied upon by us in pricing our Contracts on your behalf allow us to achieve best execution on a consistent basis or whether we need to make changes to our execution arrangements. We will also review our order execution arrangements and order execution policy in respect of material changes either in respect of one of our chosen pricing venues or that otherwise affect our ability to continue to achieve best execution. Should there be any material changes to our order execution arrangements or order execution policy, we will notify you.</p>

    <h2>Appendix - Product Specific Policies</h2>

    <h2>A. Spot FX</h2>
        <p>For features and trading illustration of Spot FX offered by Binary.com, refer to the Product Disclosure Statement. This policy is an appendix to the overarching Binary.com Order Execution Policy and should be read in conjunction with the overarching Binary.com Order Execution Policy.</p>
        <p>Binary.com provides you best execution by utilising a smart aggregation method when managing incoming orders. The smart aggregation method works by:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>consolidating liquidity from several providers into a single stream of blended feed; and</li>
            <li>intelligently routing incoming orders to different types of execution modes based on configurations and algorithms established using best execution factors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By default, the intelligent order routing system ensures that the top of the book is always comprised of the best bid and offer rates quoted by the competing liquidity providers. However, during times of market illiquidity, this may change with likelihood of execution being the primary execution factor.</p>
        <p>Depending on the level of risk that we are exposed to acting as your counterparty, we largely act in a principal capacity of your trades. As such, the execution venue will usually be Binary.com. However, we may transmit your order to third party liquidity providers, in which case we will determine the execution venue ourselves on the basis described above.</p>
        <p>The execution venues are assessed, on a regular basis, whether the they provide for the best possible result for our clients.</p>
