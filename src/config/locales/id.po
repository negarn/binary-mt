msgid "%1 offers forex and contracts for differences via the hybrid model, i.e., both dealing on own account (dealing desk) and partially hedging client orders with our liquidity providers (no-dealing desk). Client orders are typically hedged when the total transaction volume exceeds a predefined threshold of risk tolerance level. For both execution models, %1 acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that you enter into with us, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of loss for clients resulting from the fact that the counterparty to the forex and/or contracts for differences transaction that you entered into may default on its obligations prior to the final settlement of the transaction's cash flow."
