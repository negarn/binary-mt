msgid "%1 offers forex and contracts for differences via the hybrid model, i.e., both dealing on own account (dealing desk) and partially hedging client orders with our liquidity providers (no-dealing desk). Client orders are typically hedged when the total transaction volume exceeds a predefined threshold of risk tolerance level. For both execution models, %1 acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that you enter into with us, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of loss for clients resulting from the fact that the counterparty to the forex and/or contracts for differences transaction that you entered into may default on its obligations prior to the final settlement of the transaction's cash flow."
msgstr "%1通过混合模式提供外汇和差价合约，即通过自己的账户（交易员）和部分对冲客户订单与我们的流动率提供商（无交易员）进行交易。当总交易量超过预定的风险承受力水平限额时，客户订单通常被对冲。%1在两种执行模式中都扮演您与我们签订交易的合约相对方，而不是像交易所的交易金融工具那样与中央结算所订立交易的合约相对方。 因此，存在相对方风险。 相对方风险是指客户因为您签订的外汇和/或差价交易合约相对方在交易现金流最终结算前违反其义务而造成的损失风险。"
